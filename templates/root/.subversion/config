### This subversion config exists to enable the ETL of the torque-sites project.
### It exists in two forms:
### 1) as a template file in the torque-devenv repository
### 2) as a real config file in the vagrant guest machine at /root/.subversion/config
###
### If you are viewing it within the guest machine, know that any edits may be deleted
### on a re-provision, and should ALSO be made in the template file.
###
### Because this file is so special, we have pared down all of the examples / comments
### in the standard default svn config.  This hones in on the key settings used in our
### project.  You can view the git history to see the original file contents.

### Section for authentication and authorization customizations.

### We need to explicitly disable password stores in order to have passwords save properly
### on the guest machine.

### We don't use any of these sections.
