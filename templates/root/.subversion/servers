### This subversion servers fuke exists to enable the ETL of the torque-sites project.
### It exists in two forms:
### 1) as a template file in the torque-devenv repository
### 2) as a real config file in the vagrant guest machine at /root/.subversion/config
###
### If you are viewing it within the guest machine, know that any edits may be deleted
### on a re-provision, and should ALSO be made in the template file.
###
### Because this file is so special, we have pared down all of the examples / comments
### in the standard default svn config.  This hones in on the key settings used in our
### project.  You can view the git history to see the original file contents.

### Since most subversion commands being run in the guest machine are scripted, we would
### like to be able to specify the password once; by storing in plaintext it also becomes
### easier to script against in future.
